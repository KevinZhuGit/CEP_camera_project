Figure 1:

3rd row
arbitray in time and per m x n subarray
in this example m=2 n=3


VREF 3 times thicker
color not visible on comparators
not sure if we want to show comparator every subframe 


red pixel is pixel 2 is not clear


red/blue this work
orange ellipses not required



12-bit output - Per exposure ADC
1-bit output  - intra frame output


coulmn-parallel circuits



1 comparator bank at bottom
1 orange wire output on the graph
1 comparator 


2 timing diagram 
conventional CEP
conventional CEP with comparator

title: PER-PIXEL coded exposure 
remove bolded font at the 

line between top and bottom
subframe readout


2 legends 
 legend-1 : tap1 and off
 legend-2 : tap2 and off

FIGURE 2:
dashed thicker
no colors insider the subframes
no green at the top


Don't need the scene
