# High Speed rotating stick
## Camera setup
Readout: 60 rows  
Subexposures: 870 readouts  
Time: 68.4 ms  
Sampling frequency per 60 rows: 12.7 kHz  
Sampling frequency per row: 763.1 kHz  
Not operating at maximum frequency (16kHz per row) to reduce the noise from masking signals  

## VREF setup
Half sine wave changing from 2.8V to 1.1V  
The experiment is repeated for 1x, 4x, 8x, 16x cycles of half sinewave

## Experimental setup
The image is shown in scene_setup.jpg


## Observation
We can sense the rotation only once when moving object is close to saturation  
If it's not very bright (close to saturation) it is difficult to trigger.
